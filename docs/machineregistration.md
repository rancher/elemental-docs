# MachineRegistration

The MachineRegistration includes the Elemental installation configuration (provided by the user) and a registration token (generated by the <Vars name="elemental_operator_name" />), from which a registration URL is derived.

The registration URL is the way through which an host can access the <Vars name="elemental_operator_name" /> services, to kick off the Elemental provisioning process.

The MachineRegistration has a `Ready` condition which turns to true when the <Vars name="elemental_operator_name" /> has successfully generated the registration URL and an associated ServiceAccount. From this point on the target host can connect to the registration URL to kick off the provisioning process.

An HTTP GET request against the registration URL returns the _registration file_: a .yaml file containing the registration data (i.e., the _spec:config:elemental:registration_ section only from the just created MachineRegistration).
The registration file contains all the required data to allow the target host to perform self registration and start the Elemental provisioning. See the [<Vars name="elemental_register_name" /> section](#elemental-register-client) for more info on the registration process and the [config:elemental:registration section in the MachineRegistration reference](machineregistration-reference.md#configelementalregistration) for more details on the available registration options.
