`Elemental` vanilla images by default are picking upgrades by the standard upgrade channel. It means it will always get the latest published `Elemental` version by our CI.

However, it's possible to tweak the default behavior of `elemental upgrade` to point to a specific OCI image/tag, or a different release channel.

## Configuration

`elemental upgrade` during start reads the [Elemental configuration file](general_configuration) and allows to tweak the following:

```yaml
# configuration used for the 'ugrade' command
upgrade:
  # if set to true upgrade command will upgrade recovery system instead
  # of main active system
  recovery: false

  # image used to upgrade main OS
  # size in MiB
  system:
    uri: <image-spec>

  # image used to upgrade recovery OS
  # recovery images can be set to use squashfs
  recovery-system:
    fs: squashfs
    uri: oci:recovery/cos
```

The `system` and `recovery-system` objects define the OS image used for the main active system and the recovery system respectively. They both are fined by a `<image-spec>`.
