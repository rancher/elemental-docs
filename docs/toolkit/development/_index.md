  How to build Elemental?
---

Welcome!

The Elemental (containerized OS) distribution is entirely built over GitHub. You can check the pipelines in the `.github` folder to see how the process looks like.

## Forking and test on your own

By forking the `Elemental-toolkit` repository, you already have the Github Action workflow configured to start building and pushing your own `Elemental` fork.

## Building locally

The elemental-cli can be built locally using go:

From your git folder:

```bash
$> make build-cli
$> build/elemental version
v0.2.5+g4d5d1be
```

### Build an example locally

Building locally has a [set of dependencies](dependencies.md) that
should be satisfied.

Then you can run
```
# make build-os
```

### Build ISO

If using SLES or openSUSE, first install the required deps:

```
# zypper in -y squashfs xorriso dosfstools
```

and then, simply run

```
# make build-iso
```

### Run with qemu

After you have the iso locally, run

```

$> make prepare-installer-test

```

This will create a disk image and boot from the ISO.

> If the image already exists, it will NOT be overwritten.
>
> You need to run an explicit `make test-clean` to wipe the image and
> start over.
>

#### Installing

After booting from the ISO you can log in as `root` with password `cos` using ssh `ssh root@localhost:2222` and install Elemental on
the disk image with:

```
# elemental install /dev/sda
```

### Run tests

Requires: ginkgo, qemu

We have a test suite which runs over SSH.

To create the disk image:

```

$> make build-disk

```

To run the tests:

```

$> make test-smoke

```
