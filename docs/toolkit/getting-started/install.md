### Custom OEM configuration

During installation it can be specified a [cloud-init config file](../reference/cloud_init), that will be installed and persist in the system after installation:

```bash
elemental install --cloud-init [url|path] <device>
```

### Custom partitioning

When installing it's possible to specify a custom partition sizes via the configuration file (`/etc/elemental/config.yaml` by default).

```yaml
install
   partitions:
     state:
       # All sizes are in MiB
       size: 8192
     recovery:
       size: 4096
     oem:
       size: 64
     persistent:
       # zero size tells parted to use all the available
       # disk, note this is only functional for the last partition
       size: 0
```

Refer to the [config file docs](../customizing/general_configuration) for further details about all partitioning options.

In order to create additional partitions please consider the layout section on [cloud-init config file reference](../reference/cloud_init)

### Installation from 3rd party LiveCD or rescue mediums

The installer can be used to perform installations also from outside the Elemental or standard derivative ISOs.

For instance, it is possible to install Elemental (or any derivative) with the installer from another bootable medium, or a rescue mode which is booting from RAM, given there is enough free RAM available.

#### With Docker

If in the rescue system, or LiveCD you have docker available, it can be used to perform an installation

```bash
docker run --privileged -v /dev/:/dev/ -ti ghcr.io/rancher/elemental-toolkit/elemental-cli:latest install --system.uri $IMAGE $DEVICE
```

Where `$IMAGE` is the container image that we want to install (e.g. `oci:ghcr.io/rancher/elemental-toolkit/elemental-green:v0.10.7` ), elemental identifies the type of source by the URI scheme (`docker`, `channel`, `dir` or `file`). `$DEVICE` is the device where to perform the installation to (e.g. `/dev/sda`).


Note, we used the `ghcr.io/rancher/elemental-toolkit/elemental-cli:latest` image which contains the latest stable installer and the dependencies.
You can see all the versions at [GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/rancher/elemental-toolkit/elemental-cli).


#### By using manually the Elemental installer

Similarly, the same mechanism can be used without docker. Install elemental using the [Download guide](download.md) and run the follow as root:

```bash
elemental install --system.uri $IMAGE $DEVICE
```
