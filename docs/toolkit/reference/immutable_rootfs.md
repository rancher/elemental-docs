The immutable rootfs concept in Elemental is provided by a dracut module.
By default, `elemental` and derivatives will inherit an immutable setup.

A running system will look like as follows:

```
/usr/local - persistent (COS_PERSISTENT)
/oem - persistent (COS_OEM)
/etc - ephemeral
/usr - read only
/ immutable
```

This means that any changes that are not specified as cloud-init configuration are not persisting across reboots.

You can place persisting cloud-init files either in `/oem` or `/usr/local/oem`, `Elemental` already supports cloud-init [datasources](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/datasources.html), so you can use also load cloud-init configuration as standard userdata, depending on the platform. For more details on the cloud-init syntax, see the [cloud-init configuration reference](cloud_init).
