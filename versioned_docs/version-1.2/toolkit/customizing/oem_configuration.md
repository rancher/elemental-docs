There are several way to customize Elemental and a elemental-toolkit derivative:

- declaratively in runtime with cloud-config file (by overriding, or extending)
- stateful, embedding any configuration in the container image to be booted.

For runtime persistence configuration, the only supported way is with cloud-config files, [see the relevant docs](configuration_persistency).

A derivative automatically loads and executes cloud-config files during the various system [stages](stages) also inside `/system/oem` which is read-only and reserved to the system.

Derivatives that wish to override default configurations can do that by placing extra cloud-init file, or overriding completely `/system/oem` in the target image.

This is to setup for example, the default root password or the preferred upgrade channel. 

The following are the `Elemental` default oem files, which are shipped within the `cloud-config-defaults` and `cloud-config-essentials` features:

```
/system/oem/00_rootfs.yaml - defines the rootfs mountpoint layout setting
/system/oem/01_defaults.yaml - systemd defaults (keyboard layout, timezone)
/system/oem/02_upgrades.yaml - Settings for Elemental vanilla channel upgrades
/system/oem/03_branding.yaml - Branding setting, Derivative name, /etc/issue content
/system/oem/04_accounting.yaml - Default user/pass
/system/oem/05_network.yaml - Default network setup
/system/oem/06_recovery.yaml - Executes additional commands when booting in recovery mode
```

You can either override the above files, or alternatively not consume the above features while building a derivative.
