Elemental vanilla images, like ISOs, cloud images or raw disks can be used to deploy another derivative image.

## `elemental reset`

`elemental reset` can be used to reset the system from the recovery image or from a custom image. Vanilla images only include a minimal recovery partition and system.

It can be either invoked manually with `elemental reset --system.uri <img-ref>` or used in conjuction with a cloud-init configuration, for example consider the following [cloud-init configuration file](../reference/cloud_init) that creates the `state` and `persistent` partitions during first boot (this is required on Elemental vanilla images):


```yaml
name: "Default deployment"
stages:
   rootfs.after:
     - name: "Repart image"
       layout:
         # It will partition a device including the given filesystem label or part label (filesystem label matches first)
         device:
           label: COS_RECOVERY
         add_partitions:
           - fsLabel: COS_STATE
             # 10Gb for COS_STATE, so the disk should have at least 16Gb
             size: 10240
             pLabel: state
           - fsLabel: COS_PERSISTENT
             # unset size or 0 size means all available space
             pLabel: persistent
   network:
     - if: '[ -f "/run/cos/recovery_mode" ]'
       name: "Deploy Elemental system"
       commands:
         - |
             # Use `elemental reset --system.uri docker:<img-ref>` to deploy a custom image
             # By default the recovery Elemental gets deployed
             elemental reset --reboot --system.uri docker:$IMAGE
```

The following will first repartition the image after the `rootfs` [stage](../customizing/stages) and will run `elemental reset` when booting into [recovery mode](recovery). RAW vanilla disk images automatically boot by default into recovery, so the first thing upon booting is deploying the system
