This is a work in progress example of how to deploy K3S + Fleet + System Upgrade Controller over a Elemental vanilla image only
by using cloud-init yaml configuration files. The config file reproduced here is meant to be included
as a user-data in a cloud provider (aws, gcp, azure, etc) or as part of a cdrom (Elemental-Recovery will try to fetch `/userdata` file
from a cdrom device).

A vanilla image is an image that only provides the Elemental-Recovery system on a `COS_RECOVERY` partition. It does not include any other
system and it is meant to be dumped to a bigger disk and deploy a Elemental system or a derivative system over the free space in disk.
COS vanilla images are build as part of the CI workflow, see CI artifacts to download one of those.

The configuration file of this example has two purposes: first it deploys Elemental, second in reboots on the deployed OS and deploys
K3S + Fleet + System Upgrades Controller.

On first boot it will fail to boot Elemental grub menu entry and fallback
to Elemental-Recovery system. From there it will partition the vanilla image to create the main system partition (`COS_STATE`)
and add an extra partition for persistent data (`COS_PERSISTENT`). It will use the full disk, a disk of at least 20GiB
is recommended. After partitioning it will deploy the main system on `COS_STATE` and reboot to it.

On consequent boots it will simply boot from `COS_STATE`, there it prepares the persistent areas of the system (arranges few bind
mounts inside `COS_PERSISTENT`) and then it runs an standard installation of K3s, Fleet and System Upgrade Controller. After few
minutes after the system is up the K3s cluster is up and running.

Note this setup similar to the [derivative example](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cos-fleet-upgrades-sample) using Fleet.
The main difference is that this example does not require to build any image, it is pure cloud-init configuration based.
