# Upgrade Lifecycle

![Upgrade Flow](images/upgrade-lifecycle.png) 

## Components

- [Elemental Operator](https://elemental.docs.rancher.com/upgrade)

The Elemental Operator supports several ways to configure the OS version on a Cluster level.  
Whenever a new `ManagedOSIMage` is defined, a related Fleet `Bundle` is also generated by the Elemental Operator.  

- [Fleet](https://fleet.rancher.io/)

In this context, Fleet is used to apply an `upgrade.cattle.io/v1` `Plan` on each Cluster targeted by the `ManagedOSImage`.  
The `Plan` is then executed by the `System Upgrade Controller` running on the downstream Elemental Cluster.  

- [System Upgrade Controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller)

The System Upgrade Controller is an upgrade tool used by [k3s](https://docs.k3s.io/upgrades/automated) and [rke2](https://docs.rke2.io/upgrade/automated_upgrade) clusters. It should always be automatically installed on each provisioned Elemental cluster.  
In this context the System Upgrade Controller orchestrates the application of `upgrade.cattle.io/v1` `Plan` to the Elemental nodes.  

## Versioning and components lifecycle

The [Fleet](https://fleet.rancher.io/) and [System Upgrade Controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller) versions are controlled by Rancher.  

On the Rancher cluster, you can run:  

```bash
kubectl get settings fleet-version system-upgrade-controller-chart-version
```

For more information about chart versions, you can visit the [repository](https://github.com/rancher/charts) or read the [documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/helm-charts-in-rancher).

The charts version is determined by Rancher.  
Depending on how Rancher is installed, the following environment variables can be set, for example when installing the [Rancher Helm chart](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-references/helm-chart-options#setting-extra-environment-variables):  

```bash
CATTLE_SYSTEM_UPGRADE_CONTROLLER_CHART_VERSION
CATTLE_FLEET_VERSION
```

Manually updating the versions is generally not recommended.  
Also beware that a new `CATTLE_SYSTEM_UPGRADE_CONTROLLER_CHART_VERSION` will trigger a `system-upgrade-controller` chart update on all provisioned downstream clusters.  

## Verifying successful upgrades

Verifying the correct execution of the upgrade jobs is a fundamental part of ensuring the Elemental upgrade process is complete.  

To troubleshoot each step within the entire upgrade process, please consult the [related document](./troubleshooting-upgrade.md).  
This section only describes the last step needed to verify the correct application of the upgrade Plan on one targeted cluster.  

- Versions higher or equal to **v0.13.4** of the `system-upgrade-controller`:  

  ```shell
  kubectl -n cattle-system describe plan os-upgrader-my-upgrade
  ```

  Once the Plan is applied to all nodes, it will have a `Complete` status condition.

- Older versions:

  Each Plan has a `latestHash` status value that should match the Plan label on each node.  
  A simple script can be used to list all nodes where the plan has not be applied yet:  

  ```shell
  #!/bin/bash

  # This script prints a list of all nodes where an upgrade plan was not applied.  
  # To further determine the cause of failures, you can analyze the Plan status and the related jobs.
  # For ex: kubectl -n cattle-system get plans,jobs

  # Edit this variable according to your ManagedOSImage name.
  MANAGED_OS_IMAGE_NAME=my-upgrade

  PLAN_NAME=os-upgrader-$MANAGED_OS_IMAGE_NAME
  LATEST_HASH=$(kubectl -n cattle-system get plan $PLAN_NAME -o=jsonpath='{.status.latestHash}')

  printf "Plan '$PLAN_NAME' latest hash is: '$LATEST_HASH'\n"

  PLAN_LABEL=plan.upgrade.cattle.io/$PLAN_NAME
  printf "Listing all nodes with mismatching or missing label '$PLAN_LABEL':\n"
  kubectl get nodes -l $PLAN_LABEL!=$LATEST_HASH
  ```
