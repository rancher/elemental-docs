# Overview

Elemental is a software stack enabling a centralized, full cloud-native OS management with Kubernetes.

Cluster Node OSes are built and maintained via container images through the <Vars name="elemental_cli_name" /> and installed on new hosts using the <Vars link="elemental_cli_url" name="elemental_cli_name" />.

The <Vars link="elemental_operator_url" name="elemental_operator_name" /> and the <Vars link="ranchersystemagent_url" name="ranchersystemagent_name" /> enable Rancher Manager to fully control Elemental clusters, from the installation and management of the OS on the Nodes to the provisioning of new K3s or RKE2 clusters in a centralized way.

Ready to give it a try? Get an Elemental Cluster up and running following the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) section.

Want more details? Take a look at the [Architecture](architecture.md) section or reach out to the <Vars link="elemental_slack_url" name="elemental_slack_name" /> Slack channel.
